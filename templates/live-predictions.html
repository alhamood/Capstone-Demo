  <h3>NYC bike share query:</h3><p>
  Behind this website is a predictive model using factors such as hour, month, day of the week,
  and weather, along with station-specific factors. Using this model, I predict the change
  in bikes over a user-defined period of time. This is visualized using CartoDB's API,
  and the surplus number of bikes expected at each station following this time period is
  also shown. <p>
  <h4>How many hours into the future would you like to predict?</h4>  <p>
