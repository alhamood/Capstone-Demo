<h3>The goal of my project is to help the Citibike system efficiently solve a business problem.</h3> 
Specifically, redistributing bikes among stations as efficiently as possible. As the following plot
 shows, left unchecked, some stations tend to accumulate bikes over time, while others tend to lose them.
 </p><p>
 This plot shows, for each station in a different color, the cumulative gain or loss of
 bikes for the history of the system:<p>

<h3>To solve this problem, I analyzed over 22 million bike trips, to build a predictive model of user behavior.</h3> 
The model must be able to anticipate the patterns in user behavior. These patterns are defined by many
 features and temporal oscillations. For example, plotting total rides across the system's history by week 
 reveals seasonal effects and long-term growth trends:

Zooming in on a particular week, we can also observe daily temporal oscillations, as the hour of day 
has a large effect on user behavior. These oscillations also take a different form depending 
on the day of the week, with notable peaks corresponding to rush hour on weekdays:

<h4>Station-specific factors</h4>
A critical input to this model is the average change in bikes for each station. This map provides an 
overview of the average net change in bikes per station, viewed geographically via CartoDB's API. 
These data could be used to implement a baseline redistribution schedule of a desired frequency. 
Mouse-over for station names and precise monthly expectations.
