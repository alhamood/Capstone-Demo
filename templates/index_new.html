  <h3>New York bike share query:</h3>
  <p>
  Behind this website is a predictive model using factors such as hour, month, day of the week,
  and weather, along with station-specific factors. Using this model, I predict the change
  in bikes over a user-defined period of time. This is visualized using CartoDB's API,
  and the surplus number of bikes expected at each station following this time period is
  also shown. <p>
  You can also check predictions of the model for a previous date to view accuracy. This model
  is based on an extremely random forest, although for predictions greater than 24 hours 
  into the future, a decision tree is used which produces faster results.
